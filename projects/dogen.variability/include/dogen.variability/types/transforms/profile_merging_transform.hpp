 * @brief Merges profiles according to their inheritance

 *
 * This transform is really a mix of three separate transforms, but we
 * just can't figure out a good way of splitting them apart:
 *
 * @li the recursive merging up the inheritance tree, which gives it
 * its name.
 *
 * @li the creation of a repository of profiles. This requires the
 * data to be organised in a map, which is also needed for the
 * previous step.
 *
 * @li the population of the base layer profile name. This requires
 * the data to be merged (because we want the field to populate from
 * parent to children), but not yet in a repository (because we do not
 * want to have to populate the copies of the profiles).
 *
 * So, to make our life easier for now we just bundled all of these
 * responsibilities into one big transform.
