/**
 * @brief Combines a number of models into a single model.
 *
 * The role of the merger is to aggregate a number of models into a
 * single, coherent model called the @e merged model.
 *
 * There are two kinds of models:
 *
 * @li the @e target model: the model which the user is focusing on,
 * most likely with the intention of code generating it. There can
 * only be one target model for a given merge.
 *
 * @li the @e reference models; a model is a reference model if the
 * target model refers to one or more of its types - or a model
 * referred to by the target model refers to its types and so on.
 *
 * In summary, the target model cannot be evaluated without the
 * definition of all models it references, directly or
 * indirectly. Name resolution will fail if one or more of the
 * referenced models have not been supplied.
