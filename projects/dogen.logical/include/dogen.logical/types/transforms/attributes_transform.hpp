/**
 * @brief Transformation that specialises in expanding attributes
 * across the model.
 *
 * @section logical_attributes_transform_0 Model requirements
 *
 * The basic expansion of local attributes and of object templates is
 * expected to have taken place.
 *
 * @section logical_attributes_transform_1 Types of attributes
 *
 * There are three sets of attributes the expander is interested in:
 *
 * @li local attributes;
 * @li inherited attributes;
 * @li all attributes.
 *
 * Lets cover each of these in more details.
 *
 * @subsection logical_attributes_transform_11 Local attributes
 *
 * On a natural, pre-expanded state, local attributes encompass only
 * the attributes defined on the class directly. The transform behaves
 * differently depending on whether it is processing an object or an
 * object template.
 *
 * For objects, the job of the expander is to expand the local
 * attributes to include all attributes obtained by instantiating
 * object templates. This is because we treat them no differently from
 * attributes defined in the class for purposes of code generation. As
 * we rely on the object template transform, all we need is the set of
 * all attributes of all object templates we instantiate. Local
 * attributes are useful to define all member variables owned by a
 * class.
 *
 * For object templates, local attributes are untouched. This is for
 * two reasons. First, because we rely on the local attributes of
 * object templates to process the local attributes of objects, as
 * explained above, via object template expansion; thus local
 * attributes provide a quick way to access all the attributes of all
 * object templates one models. The second reason is due to the
 * representation of object templates in source code: there is no
 * requirement for a "meta-object template" - something from which
 * object templates get attributes from. There is nothing above object
 * templates that replicate the relationship we have between object
 * templates and objects. When object templates get expressed in
 * source code - say as C++ concepts - all we require is the set of
 * all attributes for that object template (see below).
 *
 * @subsection logical_attributes_transform_12 Inherited attributes
 *
 * These provide an easy way to look-up which attributes one has
 * inherited and from whom. For objects, the inherited attributes are
 * the "all attribute" set of each parent (see below). They are useful
 * to call parent constructors and the like.
 *
 * For object templates, inherited attributes are not particularly
 * useful. We still index them by, arbitrarily, adding all the local
 * attributes of the parent. However, we haven't yet found a good use
 * case for them.
 *
 * @subsection logical_attributes_transform_13 All attributes
 *
 * The "all attribute" set contains every single attribute. It is the
 * sum all the local attributes with all of the inherited
 * attributes. For objects it is useful for full constructors. For
 * object templates it is effectively the full interface of the object
 * template.
