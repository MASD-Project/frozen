Time to flush all those tabs again. Some interesting stuff I bumped
into recently-ish.

* Finance

  blockchain...
- [[http://www.joecoin.com/2015/02/crypto-20-and-other-misconceptions.html][Crypto 2.0--And Other Misconceptions]]: ... but maybe we are getting a
  bit ahead of ourselves, and bitcoin is really what matters!
- [[http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/][How the Bitcoin protocol actually works]]: Gory details of bitcoin's
  internals. Must say that the [[http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032281.do][BitCoin book]] already provides a pretty
  good explanation, but interesting nonetheless.
- [[http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/11/03/bitbeat-bitcoin-surges-past-400-on-back-of-the-new-shining-star/][BitBeat: Bitcoin Surges Past $400 on Back of the New ‘Shining Star’]]:
  BitCoin is up again! Rollercoaster ride?
- [[http://modval.org/home/][ModVal]]: How cool is that, a site for financial models.

* Startups et. al.

- [[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/shape-things-come][The Shape of Things to Come]]: Jonathan Ive seems like a cool fellow,
  actually. Even though I'm not much of an apple fan.
- [[http://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-continuity-fund][Y Combinator Posthaven]]: thoughts from the combinator. 1000 companies
  funded!
- [[https://medium.com/@EskoKilpi/movement-of-thought-that-led-to-airbnb-and-uber-9d4da5e3da3a#.d2dvu2nub][The Future of Firms. Is There an App for That?]]: What does it mean to
  be a company in this world of change?

* General Coding

  trenches.
- [[https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/two/git-from-the-inside-out][Git from the inside out]]: Gory details about git. And I mean *really*
  gory and *really* detailed. As with bitcoin, the [[http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596520137.do][git book]] was
  already pretty detailed but interesting nonetheless.
- [[http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/][How to Write a Git Commit Message]]: jeez, each to their own! Here's a
  true geek of git commit messages. But very useful though.
- [[http://www.benstopford.com/2015/04/28/elements-of-scale-composing-and-scaling-data-platforms/][Elements of Scale: Composing and Scaling Data Platforms]]: Interesting
  take on data, should help navigate the SQL/NoSQL debate.
- [[http://apihandyman.io/do-you-really-know-why-you-prefer-rest-over-rpc/][Do you really know why you prefer REST over RPC?]]: Title says it all,
  interesting take on the RESTification of the world.
- [[http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/10/12/making-the-case-for-building-scalable-stateful-services-in-t.html][Making The Case For Building Scalable Stateful Services In The
  Modern Era]]: Instead of knee-jerk reactions about statefulness, think
  deeply before you decide. With presentation: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DH0i_bXKwujQ]["Building Scalable
  Stateful Services" by Caitie McCaffrey]]
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D9RMOc0SwRro]["Apache Kafka and the Next 700 Stream Processing Systems" by Jay
  Kreps]]: Improved my understanding of Kafka somewhat. And the title
  made me curious, so I ended up reading [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Landin66.pdf][The Next 700 Programming
  Languages]].
- [[http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/where-was-the-internet-born/413221/][The Room Where the Internet Was Born]]: A quest for understanding the
  cloud. Rather long but great for those that like computer history.
- [[http://www.aaron-gray.com/a-criticism-of-scrum/][A Criticism of Scrum]]: quite well thought out actually. I love agile
  but I must say, I agree with many of the points made. I guess in the
  end, the key is not to fall in love with ceremony.

* Databases

- [[http://gotocon.com/dl/goto-berlin-2013/slides/HenningJacobs_and_ValentineGogichashvili_WhyZalandoTrustsInPostgreSQL.pdf][Why Zalando trusts in PostgreSQL]]: Great to see how the elephant is
  used in anger. Picked up a few tips.

  Compilers! Oh My!]]: Chandler at his best - hilarious but extremely
  informative.
- [[http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4367.html][Comparison in C++]]: A weird but weirdly useful paper. Deep thinking
  about comparisons. For good measure, you should also watch the
  presentation: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dfi0CQ7laiXE][CppCon 2015: Lawrence Crowl "Comparison is not simple,
  but it can be simpler"]]
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DmFUXNMfaciE][CppCon 2015: Eric Niebler "Ranges for the Standard Library"]]: Ranges,
  ranges, ranges!! Can't wait! For good measure, you can also read [[http://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/17/c-ranges-are-pure-monadic-goodness/][C++
  Ranges are Pure Monadic Goodness]].
- [[https://cryptocoding.net/index.php/Coding_rules][Crypto coding rules]]: haven't parsed the entire document, but already
  found a few very useful points.

  come in handy at some point...

  matrices accessible.

- [[http://esciencecommons.blogspot.co.uk/2011/01/new-theories-reveal-nature-of-numbers.html][New theories reveal the nature of numbers]]: A [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0787524/][Ramanujan movie]] is due
  out soon, and these are the guys doing the maths behind the
  scenes. Can't wait for the movie!
- [[http://v.cx/2010/04/feynman-brazil-education][Richard Feynman on education in Brazil]]: Hilarious, but somewhat
  reminiscent of my own education, in a different country but
  culturally very similar and certainly with a very similar approach
  to science.
- [[http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html][Using neural nets to recognize handwritten digits]]: nice introduction
  to neural nets with a good example.
- [[http://nautil.us/issue/15/turbulence/your-brain-is-on-the-brink-of-chaos][Your Brain Is On the Brink of Chaos]]: *Very* interesting. This is
  particularly interesting because I have been reading up on the
  delicate balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurons, but the
  literature always gives you this static impression of balance. If
  you assume chaos on the other hand...
- The Proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem by R.Taylor and A.Wiles: OK,
  going to confess, haven't finished reading this yet. But

* Other

- [[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/01/extreme-city-specter][Extreme City]]: Luanda, my beloved, just keeps on getting crazier and
  crazier. Interesting - if somewhat expat-oriented - take on the
  city.

  Happened to Her in 2013]]: sad, really. Whatever the real truth was
  about Ahmed.
- [[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/opinion/sunday/will-you-ever-be-able-to-upload-your-brain.html?_r%3D1][Will You Ever Be Able to Upload Your Brain?]]: er., spoiler alert -
  not really. Interesting though.
- [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/50282823/Flash%2520BBG%25202015-%2520October-Taleb.pptx.pdf][Dealing with “power laws” with upper (lower) bound]]: most certainly
  not for laypeople. Taleb is back at it. Would be great to have this
  translated to laymen's maths.
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D5mcyUUf20Ng&feature%3Dyoutu.be&list%3DPL37ZVnwpeshH37NxpV6XbgdDpY-w48hMd][Lieke Boon: Unconscious Bias]]: we're all guilty: How to be a bit more
