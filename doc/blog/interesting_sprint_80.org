Time to flush all those tabs again. Some interesting stuff I bumped
into recently-ish.

* Finance, Economics, Politics

- [[http://www.ted.com/talks/yanis_varoufakis_capitalism_will_eat_democracy_unless_we_speak_up?utm_campaign%3Dsocial&utm_medium%3Dreferral&utm_source%3Dt.co&utm_content%3Dtalk&utm_term%3Dglobal-social%2520issues#t-874630][Yanis Varoufakis: Capitalism will eat democracy -- unless we speak
  up]]: Very interesting Ted talk by Varoufakis.
- [[http://www.salon.com/2016/02/04/naomi_klein_there_are_no_non_radical_options_left_before_us_partner/][Naomi Klein: “There are no non-radical options left before us"]]: I
  always have time for Naomi Klein even if I don't always agree with
  her. Very interesting post on market failures (predictably).
- [[http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/28/apple-quarterly-results-iphone-silicon-valley-developers][Apple – losing out on talent and in need of a killer new device]]:
  Very interesting post on Apple, and how it is not cool with the cool
  developers any longer. Good read and worrying one for Apple.
- [[http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/01/the-low-tricks-of-high-finance-how-greedy-bankers-weak-politicians-and-timid-journalists-could-cause-a-new-crash/][The low tricks of high finance: how greedy bankers, weak politicians
  and timid journalists could cause a new crash]]. Always have time for
  Michael Lewis. While waiting for the Big Short, this article kept me
  entertained.
- [[http://bottlerocketscience.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/startup-geometry-ep-016-emanuel-derman.html][Startup Geometry EP 016 Emanuel Derman]]: Postcast with uber nerd,
  quintessential Quant and fellow African Emanuel Derman.

* Startups et al.

- Spotify engineering culture: [[https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/][Part I]], [[https://labs.spotify.com/2014/09/20/spotify-engineering-culture-part-2/][Part II]]. "Oldie" but
  goodie. How a modern company is organised, for raw efficiency.
- [[http://www.themacro.com/articles/2016/01/advice-startups-running-out-of-money/][Advice for Companies With Less Than 1 Year of Runway]]: Lots of useful
  bits of advice for how to manage your runway. Source: Hacker News
  (twitter).
- [[http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/the-truth-hidden-by-ibms-buybacks/][The Truth Hidden by IBM’s Buybacks]]: Something slightly dodgy seems
  to be going on in IBM, very strange financial transactions!
- [[http://www.wired.com/2016/02/ai-is-changing-the-technology-behind-google-searches/][AI Is Transforming Google Search. The Rest of the Web Is Next]]:
  Google is moving from a "human algo" approach to AI in search. Very
  interesting.
- [[http://gavinandresen.ninja/a-guided-tour-of-the-2mb-fork][A Guided Tour of the 2mb Fork]]: The BTC main man Gavin takes us on a
  detailed tour of one of the BTC forks. Source: Hacker News (twitter)
- [[http://www.coindesk.com/state-of-bitcoin-blockchain-2016/?utm_content%3Dbufferccc2b&utm_medium%3Dsocial&utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&utm_campaign%3Dbuffer][State of Bitcoin and Blockchain 2016]]: Blockchain Hits Critical Mass:
  A very detailed - some say /too detailed/ - look at BTC
  in 2016. Source: CoinDesk (twitter).
- [[http://www.wired.com/2016/02/why-bitcoin-will-thrive-first-in-the-developing-world/?utm_content%3Dbuffer9ce0d&utm_medium%3Dsocial&utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&utm_campaign%3Dbuffer][Why Bitcoin Will Thrive First in the Developing World]]: Most
  interesting hypothesis - that BTC will first gain lots of traction
  in the developing world - but to me, it fails slightly to provide
  enough evidence. It reminds me how I always thought that Linux would
  explode in the developing world, but in the end it was the developed
  world that took the lead, whereas the poorer nations simply pirated
  windows. I want to believe them, but unfortunately reality does not
  tend to be that linear. Source: CoinDesk (twitter)
- [[http://blog.nootch.net/2016/02/02/on-motivation-and-shipping/][On motivation, shipping and startups]]: Great post on life on the
  start-up trenches. Source: Bruno Antunes (twitter)
- [[http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/18/why-big-companies-keep-failing-the-stack-fallacy/#.xiisrb:9sQZ][Why Big Companies Keep Failing: The Stack Fallacy]]: Interesting
  hypothesis but not sure if totally buy it: "Stack fallacy is the
  mistaken belief that it is trivial to build the layer above
  yours.". Does seem to explain some behaviour that appears to be
  pretty irrational otherwise though.
- [[https://backchannel.com/the-next-social-media-we-want-and-need-2d03a7e0551c#.a07nlopz1][The Next Social Media We Want and Need!]]: The next social media
  revolution, apparently. Some good ideas but as always, I fear they
  overestimate people's demand for privacy - unfortunately.

* General Coding

- [[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/26/business/marvin-minsky-pioneer-in-artificial-intelligence-dies-at-88.html][Marvin Minsky, Pioneer in Artificial Intelligence, Dies at 88]]:
  Minsky is no more. Sad day for our field.
- [[https://medium.com/backchannel/marvin-minsky-s-marvelous-meat-machine-f436aec02fdf#.qcarjjdif][Marvin Minsky’s Marvelous Meat Machine]]: Levy's eulogy to Minsky. I
  met Minsky through [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hackers-Heroes-Computer-Revolution-Anniversary/dp/1449388396/ref%3Dsr_1_3?ie%3DUTF8&qid%3D1453930109&sr%3D8-3&keywords%3Dhackers][Hackers]] so this is particularly poignant.
- [[http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2016/01/farewell-marvin-minsky-19272016/][Farewell, Marvin Minsky (1927–2016)]]: Wolfram's eulogy to
  Minsky. Most excellent and, dare I say, almost humble.
- [[https://github.com/blog/2042-git-2-5-including-multiple-worktrees-and-triangular-workflows][Git 2.5, including multiple worktrees and triangular workflows]]: I
  seemed to have missed this extremely useful new feature in Git. If
  you have too, check it out.
- [[http://sealedabstract.com/rants/nanomsg-postmortem-and-other-stories/][nanomsg postmortem and other stories]]: Extremely interesting post on
  FOSS projects, project governance and personalities. Hat tip: Bruno
  Antunes (twitter)
- [[http://www.iron.io/blog/2016/01/microcontainers-tiny-portable-containers.html][Microcontainers – Tiny, Portable Docker Containers]]: [[http://www.iron.io/][iron.io]] has a
  repo of Dockerfiles with really small images. Source: Hacker News
  (twitter)
- [[https://www.brianchristner.io/docker-is-moving-to-alpine-linux/][Docker Official Images are Moving to Alpine Linux]]: After the whole
  excitement around [[http://www.iron.io/][iron.io]], we all started to pay attention to Alpine
  and it seems so did docker. It certainly would be great to have
  sensible sized base images, but not quite sure about using a
  different libc. Lets see how this plays out! Source: Hacker News
  (twitter)
- [[http://www.eweek.com/virtualization/coreos-launches-docker-rival-rkt-1.0.html][CoreOS Launches Docker Rival Rkt 1.0]]: Rocket reaches 1.0. Still
  haven't used it, but still rooting on the sidelines - docker needs
  competition. Source: Hacker News (twitter)
- [[https://vimeo.com/56748054][Kevlin Henney - It Is Possible to Do Object-Oriented Programming in
  Java]]: haven't seen it yet, but being a Kevlin presentation I
  recommend it without hesitation. Can't wait to watch it.
- [[https://yow.eventer.com/yow-2013-1080/the-solid-design-principles-deconstructed-by-kevlin-henney-1386][The SOLID Design Principles Deconstructed]]: Another Henney special,
  next on the play list.
- [[http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/sciam.inherit.html]]: As we
  morn Minsky, we start to rediscover his papers. Oldie but
  goodie. The man was a true genius.

* Databases

- [[http://dailytechvideo.com/video-435-simon-riggs-databases-the-long-view/][Databases - the Long View]]: good presentation on databases and
  Postgres in particular, giving you a perspective of how things
  changed over time.

* C++

- [[https://github.com/ipkn/crow][Crow]]: New find. Simple library to write web services in C++. If you
  need to quickly expose some code as a web service, this may be
  easier than using [[https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk][Casablanca]].

* Layperson Science

- [[http://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/when-water-flows-uphill/][When Water Flows Uphill]]: How science can be great fun. Dying to try
  this with my kids. Source: Hacker News (twitter)
- [[http://gizmodo.com/heres-why-finding-gravitational-waves-would-be-such-a-b-1752286165][Why Finding Gravitational Waves Would Be Such a Big Deal]]: Layperson
  introduction to gravitational waves and why they are important.
- [[https://tincman.wordpress.com/2011/01/04/research-paper-management-with-emacs-org-mode-and-reftex/][Research Paper Management with Emacs, org-mode and RefTeX]]: I
  personally have been using [[https://github.com/mcraveiro/referencer][Gnome Referencer]] for my reference
  management, but I should have known there would be an Emacs
  solution. Will move over to this when I have the time.
- [[https://github.com/emacsmirror][Emacs Mirror]]: Lots and lots of emacs packages. I am currently using
  this as an inspiration to find new packages such as [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/wsd-mode][wsd-mode]], a
  WebSequenceDiagrams mode - pretty nifty. Its all in ELPA/MELPA etc
  but somehow the GitHub interface seems to make it more discoverable?
