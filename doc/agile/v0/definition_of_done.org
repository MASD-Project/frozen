* About

This document defines what we considered to be the objective of
release v1.0; once all these boxes have been ticked, we can ship it.

* What do we need to achieve

The following must be attained in order for it to be done:

- it must be possible to add a new file formatter by just adding a new
  stitch template.
- dynamic extensions must be able to supply licences, copyright
  information and all other user specific information. Nothing is
  hard-coded.
- unstable packages (e.g latest) must be available for Download off of
  CI.
- a language other than C++ must be supported in order to prove that
  the framework works with multiple languages.
- a basic manual must exist, with both user and developer information,
  including examples all the main features of Dogen.
