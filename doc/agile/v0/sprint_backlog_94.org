Title: Dogen v0.93.0, "Tombwa"

#+begin_src markdown
Overview
=======
The sprint's headline feature is the start of the C# kernel. It is only an experimental feature, but Dogen can already generate the basic infrastructure such as projects, solutions and simple classes. Only primitives are supported at present. For an example of a C# model see the test data sets:

- input: [Dia](https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/test_data/yarn.dia/input/CSharpModel.dia), [JSON](https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/test_data/yarn.json/input/CSharpModel.json)
- output: [CSharpModel](https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/tree/master/projects/test_models/CSharpModel)

Most of the work carried out this sprint was related to adding multiple kernels to Dogen, so it is not user visible. Similarly, most of the remaining work was related to the C# kernel.

User visible changes
===============

- when outputting more than one kernel, Dogen now adds a kernel specific directory (e.g. ```cpp```. ```csharp```).
- the ```--project-dir``` command line option has been renamed to ```--output-dir```
- the ```hardware``` model has been split into language-specific "builtin" models

For more details see the [sprint log](https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/sprint_backlog_93.org).

Binaries
======
You can download experimental binaries from [Bintray](https://bintray.com/domaindrivenconsulting/Dogen) for OSX and Linux:

- [dogen_0.93.0_amd64-applications.deb](https://dl.bintray.com/domaindrivenconsulting/Dogen/0.93.0/dogen_0.93.0_amd64-applications.deb)

*** COMPLETED Add travis support for bintray                          :story:
    CLOSED: [2016-12-12 Mon 15:12]

*Rationale*: as of sprint 93 we are now generating packages in bintray
for OSX and Debian.

There is a new web application that interfaces with GitHub:
[[https://bintray.com/][bintray]].

- add JSON validation to bintray deployment descriptor.

Notes:

- an account was created [[https://bintray.com/mcraveiro][linked to GitHub]].
- it supports the uploads of [[https://bintray.com/mcraveiro/deb][debs]].
- [[https://bintray.com/docs/usermanual/uploads/uploads_howdoiuploadmystufftobintray.html][How Do I Upload My Stuff to Bintray?]]
- [[https://github.com/tim-janik/beast][Beast]] project [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tim-janik/beast/master/README.md][README]] with emblems
- Beast [[https://github.com/tim-janik/beast/blob/master/.travis.yml][travis.yml]]
- [[https://github.com/tim-janik/rapicorn/blob/master/citool.sh.][citool.sh]] script from [[https://github.com/tim-janik/rapicorn][Rapicorn]] project and their [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tim-janik/rapicorn/master/README.md][README]].

At present we are getting the following error:

: Skipping a deployment with the bintray provider because this branch is not permitted

This was fixed. We are now getting the following errors:

: Installing deploy dependencies
: [Bintray Upload] Reading descriptor file: build/scripts/bintray.json
: [Bintray Upload] Creating package 'auto-upload'...
: [Bintray Upload] Bintray response: 400 Bad Request. License 'GPL3' does not exist

: [Bintray Upload] Bintray response: 404 Not Found. Package 'auto-upload' was not found

Actually now we can't even find the bintray file:

Ok so now we can find the bintray file but the upload fails with a

It is now clear we will need helpers:

- types: floating point comparison.
- test data: for most proxy types.
- io: for most proxy types.

Add all of the required infrastructure to C# so we can make use of
helpers in these facets.

Notes:

- problem: we are transforming only those types for which we have
  formatters. This worked ok in C++ because we pretty much have
  formatters for all types. However, in C# we've only hooked
  =object=. This means we are filtering out all primitives, which then
  means helpers cannot bind. This also illustrates that helper
  families are really a yarn level concept - or at least should be
  extracted from the model prior to transformation. It is also a bit
  surprising that the transformer is performing some kind of
  reduction.
- we need to add "is enabled" to suppress number helpers for
  non-floating point elements in types. We also need to split the wale
  template for the helpers that need a different "is enabled".

Families:

- boolean
- object
- string
- character
- number

We need some basic support for Equals and GetHashCode.

Links:

- [[http://www.loganfranken.com/blog/692/overriding-equals-in-c-part-2/][Overriding Equals in C# (Part 2)]]
- [[http://www.loganfranken.com/blog/698/overriding-equals-in-c-part-3/][Overriding Equals in C# (Part 3)]]

Problems with GetHashCode:

: Types/AllBuiltins.cs(109,38): error CS0176: Static member `object.ReferenceEquals(object, object)' cannot be accessed with an instance reference, qualify it with a type name instead
: Types/AllBuiltins.cs(111,38): error CS0176: Static member `object.ReferenceEquals(object, object)' cannot be accessed with an instance reference, qualify it with a type name instead

We need a way to know if a type has a static GetHashCode or not.

We also need a way to compare floating point numbers. In both cases
the easiest thing is to use helpers. See:

- [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3874627/floating-point-comparison-functions-for-c-sharp][Floating point comparison functions for C#]]

    if (a == b)
    { // shortcut, handles infinities

We need to first implement the main C# features in MonoDevelop, and
then use that as a starting point for the templates.

Nuget:

: nuget restore Dogen.TestModels.sln

Build:

: xbuild Dogen.TestModels.sln

Run tests:

: mono packages/NUnit.ConsoleRunner.3.5.0/tools/nunit3-console.exe CSharpModel.Tests/bin/Debug/CSharpModel.Tests.dll

We have a problem with this approach: when we build from msbuild we
generate obj and bin directories; these then cause errors in the
codegen tests. We solved this in the Travis build by doing the C#
build at the end, but this is not ideal for local development.

The requirements are:

- we must be able to build from monodevelop without breaking code gen
  tests;
- we must be able to diff and rebase the monodevelop code.

One way to achieve this is to delete these directories after we copy
the data set across.

- namespaces for dumpers on other models
- use helper or dumper
- is simple type or not
- needs quotes or not
- needs tidy-up or not

Notes:

- create a dumper registrar per model
- add a static constructor that registers the dumper
- at the meta-model level we need to be able to distinguish between
  a) primitives that need quoting and those that do not b) proxy types
  with helpers c) regular model types with dumpers d) regular model
  types with dumpers and inheritance.

Tasks:

- Implement dumper registrar in MonoDevelop
- dumpers do not have the correct postfix
- change project to backslashes

Now we've finished adding sequence generators and io support with
tests manually, we need to make the code generator match the
handcrafted code.

- qualified name support
- camel case support
- dumper does not have "Dumper" prefix
- no properties still needs methods
- helpers must end in "Dumper" since we're using that as the facet
  postfix. Also, its very confusing to have helpers which are not
  Dogen helpers. We need to rename them.

Add all the machinery needed to generate enums in C#. We need to also
add the flag for default enum:

:         "is_default_enumeration_type": true,

This is causing errors at the moment:

: std::exception::what: Type not found: is_default_enumeration_type

Which is weird since it exists in C++. Actually this is not a

Add support for association with other model types.

Problems:

- the key problem is helpers: we do not have a formatter for
  =Default=. The quick solution for this may just be to inject this
  family against an empty list of helpers.
- we have been using sequences for handling calls to add with member
  separator. However, this won't work in the case of model types which
  have a completely different API. We need to somehow have two
  different values in the sequence, depending of the type or somehow
  make the API consistent.

The C++ options have an attribute called

top-level directory that will contain the project directory. In
addition, this is not really C++ specific at all; it would apply to
any kernel and sub-kernel. We should rename it and move it to output
options.

We need to update the templates to cope with single-inheritance in

Problems:

- child equals is not calling parent's

*Rationale*: We need to keep it as is for now. See analysis below.

In yarn's =Stateful= we have a map of parent name to attributes. But
the entire code base assumes we can only have one parent for an
object. Drop the map, and use a list.

Actually this keeps track of the inheritance graph.

Actually that's not quite right either. We do keep track of properties
for our "direct" parent, and as such for objects there can only be one
such parent. However, this is used in the =Stateful= concept which is
also used by concepts themselves, and they do support multiple
inheritance. Thus if we changed it to a list we'd break concepts. This
requires quite a bit of thinking. A story for this is backlogged.

We need a constructor that takes in all properties.

Actually we should take on this story after inheritance, because the
implementation is affected by it.

We also need a parameterless constructor for serialisation purposes.

*** CANCELLED Split =Stateful= concept with regards to inheritance    :story:
    CLOSED: [2016-12-23 Fri 20:37]

*Rationale*: we will need multiple inheritance in order to support C#.

At present both concepts and objects use the =Stateful= concept in
order to have attributes. The problem is with
=inherited_attributes=. For objects we can only have
single-inheritance, so this map of names to list of attributes
introduces unnecessary complexity. However, for concepts we do support
multiple inheritance and this is a key requirement.

If we decide never to support multiple inheritance at the object
level - which may be desirable, given we are yet to find a use case
and also we now support C# which does not have multiple inheritance -
then we should split this property into two, one for each. We should
remove it from the concept. We could make use of the =Generalization=
concept, etc.

We need to be able to express relationships such as the ones used by
C# containers. But first we need to build an inheritance graph of all
relevant collections.

Notes:

- if we have leaves at all levels of an hierarchy, we may need to map
  them to the base class. Actually, in practice, we only care about
  leaves at the base class level.
- we need to know which root parent we are visiting. So presumably the
  question is: did we use root parent as a short-hand for visitation
  root?
- equals method is using root parent because apparently "service leafs
  are not being processed atm". We should remove this check and add a
  method to assistant that checks there is one root parent.

Notes:

- abstract types require knowing the leaves. We could use the existing
  machinery to map them.
- many c# types implement multiple interfaces; we need support for
  multiple inheritance at the non-proxy model level.
