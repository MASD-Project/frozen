* About

This document defines what we consider to be the objective of release
v2.0; once all these boxes have been ticked, we can ship it.

* What do we need to achieve

The following must be attained in order for it to be done:

- all models must have doxygen documentation describing their
  purpose. The key types should be documented too.
- sanity scripts must run on all packages across all platforms to
  ensure we are providing good packages.
- stable packages must be available in Debian via apt-get.
- we must have full support for C# and Windows.
- a basic manual must exist, with both user and developer information,
  including examples all the main features of Dogen.

All of these tasks are already in the backlog.
