#+begin_src markdown
![Academia de Pesca](http://cdn1.portalangop.co.ao/angola/pt_pt/files/highlight/2015/10/45/0,6bd49eb1-adcc-40fd-93c8-257b4d4aae16.jpg)
_Academia de Pesca, Namibe. (C) Angola Press._

Overview
=======

This was an extremely quiet and long sprint, mainly focused on reading the literature on Model Driven Engineering.

User visible changes
===============
In this sprint, a couple of minor user visible features were added:

- **Emacs mode for stitch**: we now have syntax highlighting in emacs for stitch templates.

For more details of the work carried out this sprint, see the [sprint log](https://github.com/DomainDrivenConsulting/dogen/blob/master/doc/agile/v1/sprint_backlog_01.org).

Next Sprint
===========
In the next sprint we'll continue to work on cleaning up yarn's internals.

Binaries
======

Tasks:

- in yarn, implement:
  - model generation chain;
  - initial target chain; and
  - exogenous transforms (registration etc).
- in the frontends: implement the exogenous transforms interface.
- update knit to conditionally use the transforms code or the legacy
  code.

    CLOCK: [2017-07-07 Fri 12:59]--[2017-07-07 Fri 13:18] =>  0:19

This story may be too big as one story.

Tasks:

- implement all of the transforms required by the pre-processing
  chain.
- implement the pre-processing chain in terms of those transforms.
- plug in the pre-processing chain into the initial target chain.

*** COMPLETED Refactor mapping repository factory                     :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-07-07 Fri 15:23]
    CLOCK: [2017-07-07 Fri 15:11]--[2017-07-07 Fri 15:23] =>  0:12

At present we are doing a lot of work in the intermediate model
repository factory that is mapping related. It would make more sense
to just have the mapping repository factory take on all of that work.

*** COMPLETED Implement the output languages transform                :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-07-07 Fri 15:41]
    CLOCK: [2017-07-07 Fri 15:24]--[2017-07-07 Fri 15:41] =>  0:17
    CLOCK: [2017-07-07 Fri 14:51]--[2017-07-07 Fri 15:11] =>  0:20

Tasks:

- create a transform that expands an intermediate model into a number
  of models, mapped to languages.
- update the initial target chain to perform the language expansion to
  the target.

*** COMPLETED Use forward declaration for context                     :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-07-07 Fri 21:19]
    CLOCK: [2017-07-07 Fri 20:59]--[2017-07-07 Fri 21:19] =>  0:20

We've implemented a number of transforms using context
references. Now, when we change context, we end up with a massive
rebuild. We should be able to change all of the headers to include the
forward declaration.

*** COMPLETED Implement the references chain                          :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-07-08 Sat 17:17]

    CLOCK: [2017-07-07 Fri 21:20]--[2017-07-07 Fri 22:03] =>  0:43

Tasks:

- implement the references expansion in the references chain.
- plug in the references chain into the model generation chain.
- consider using a multi-threaded approach. If its too hard we should
  just stick to the single-threaded implementation we have at present.

Notes:

- add a reference extractor to extract all paths
- make references chain PIM - but language must match target's. this
  won't work: target LAM, converts to C#, reference is C#; reference
  gets dropped. We need to supply all of the languages (input and
  output) and if there is a match, we need to keep the reference.
- handle PSM in model generation chain, for both target and references

*** COMPLETED Implement the merge transform                           :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-07-08 Sat 18:24]
    CLOCK: [2017-07-08 Sat 17:44]--[2017-07-08 Sat 18:24] =>  0:40

We need to refactor the existing merger into a one-shot transform that
takes a list of partial models and returns the merged model.

    CLOCK: [2017-07-08 Sat 17:31]--[2017-07-08 Sat 17:44] =>  0:13

Tasks:

- implement the output languages expansion, considering
  multi-threading. If its too hard we should just stick to the
  single-threaded implementation we have at present.

Tasks:

- implement all internal transforms required by the post-processing
  chain.
- implement the external transform chain.

Notes:

- for the external chain, we need to generate the decorations
  properties factory within the chain.

*** COMPLETED Move helpers from =transforms= namespace                :story:

    CLOCK: [2017-07-09 Sun 11:42]--[2017-07-09 Sun 11:48] =>  0:06

We should try to keep the transforms namespace clean and only have
transformation related code there. All other code that is not
meta-model types should go to a generic namespace such as "helpers".

- validator
- indexer

Now we have placed all the transforms under namespace =transforms=,
for symmetry purposes it would be nice to have some top-level
namespace for the data types. Names:

- entities
- meta-model
- ...

If we cannot find any good names, we may need to leave these objects
at the top-level. However, we should probably also place the code
generator at the top-level as well.

Notes:

- name flattener should be in helpers
- bug in resolution: cannot refer to a top-level namespace from
  another top-level namespace

We originally placed artefacts in formatters. In the new
understanding, it is actually a yarn meta-model concept. Move it
across, with associated infrastructure (writers).

Actually this does not result in a cleaner model: we need artefacts
even when we do not use yarn: stitcher. Since this is not an obvious
win, we'll cancel it for now.

Tasks:

  context.
- update kernel interfaces to use the context.

Actually this won't work because we need the root annotation in order
to generate the decorations property factory. This cannot be done when
context is being created.

*Rationale*: implemented on previous sprints.

We tried to generate windows packages by using the NSIS tool, but
there are no binaries available for it at present. However, it seems
CPack can now generate MSIs directly:

- [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18437356/how-to-generate-msi-installer-with-cmake][How to generate .msi installer with cmake?]]
- [[https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/module/CPackWIX.html][CPackWIX]]

We need to investigate how to get the build to produce MSIs using WIX.

There is not particularly good reason for this file to exist at the

In order to implement this story we need to have a working odb setup
to test it and ensure we didn't break anything.

*** COMPLETED References to objects in package should assume package  :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-07-14 Fri 12:11]

*Rationale*: implemented in previous sprints.

#+begin_quote
*Story*: As a dogen user, I don't want to have to specify fully
qualified names when referring to types in the same package so that I
don't have to type information that can be deduced by the system.
#+end_quote

At present if we define two objects in a package =p=, say =a= and =b=,
where =b= refers to =a= it must do so using a fully qualified path,
e.g.: =p::a=. Failure to do so results in an error:

: 2014-09-10 08:27:10.662113 [ERROR] [sml.resolver] Object has property with undefined type:  { "__type__": "dogen::sml::qname", "model_name": "", "external_module_path": [ ] , "module_path": [ ] , "simple_name": "registrar" }

This should be fairly trivial to implement: all we need to do is to
add =owner= to =resolve_name= in =resolver= and add an extra
resolution step that uses the owner's location.

Seems like the correct way of finding libraries is to use
=CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH= as explained [[https://blogs.kde.org/2008/12/12/how-get-cmake-find-what-you-want-it][in this article]]. We should stop using
any references to PFH and let the users provide a path to local
installs via this.

We need to add a note on the read me too.

*** COMPLETED Consider renaming dependencies to references in model   :story:

*** COMPLETED Do not copy models in merger                            :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-07-14 Fri 12:19]

*Rationale*: new implementation of merge transform fixes this.

At present we are adding the partial models into the merger by copying
them into an associative container. It would be nicer to avoid the
copying as it adds no value. This should wait until we have a way to
get performance numbers out.

In fact do we even need to have a two step process? Can we not add and
merge as we go along.

*** COMPLETED Improve cross model visitation support                  :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-07-14 Fri 12:20]

*Rationale*: implemented in previous sprints.

One of the problems we have at present is that its not possible to
define a base class in a model with a visitor and then extend it in
leaves in order
to dispatch. There seem to be some ideas in this space which may
provide a solution:

- [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11796121/implementing-the-visitor-pattern-using-c-templates][Implementing the visitor pattern using C++ Templates]]

One simpler but hacky way of solving this problem is perhaps to have
"model specific" visitors in each model, and have them extend the base
visitor. Clients can then decide which visitor to use. This does mean
that if two models are extending the base visitor, you will need to
visit twice, but at least for the most common case (one model
extending another) it provides a workable solution.

*Rationale*: removing quilt solved this problem.

When we invoke =knit_quilt= for some reason we seem to knit
=quilt.cpp=:

: $ ninja knit_quilt
: [1/1] Knitting Quilt C++ model

This seems to be some kind of ninja "feature".

For the moment we've put in a very ugly fix: we renamed the target
=knit_quiltx=.

It seems that the concepts around enablement are actually not kernel
specific but instead can be generalised at the meta-model level. We
need to create adequate representations in yarn to handle facets,
etc. We then need to move across the code that computes enablement
into yarn so that all kernels can make use of it.

Problems:

- we are checking to see if the hash facet is enabled with c++ 98; if
  so, we throw as this facet is incompatible. We cannot do this from
  yarn since we do not know what c++ standards are.
- because we do not have a mapping between a archetype location and
  the meta-type, we will be enabling/disabling all archetype locations
  across all meta-types.
- because we do not have element segmentation, the element extensions
  will be disabled. Actually this will probably work just the same,
  given that all elements exist.
- enablement must be done after external transformations so it picks
  up fabric types.
- we need to support formatting styles in order to be able to use the
  artefact properties from the meta-model.
- in quilt.cpp, someone did an upfront generation of all archetype
  properties against the archetype locations. We not doing that in
  yarn, so nothing is coming out. This was done during transformation
  in formattables.
- with a move into yarn, we seem to have broken the overwrite flag
  logic; changes no longer result in new code being generated.
- we also have borked the includes: dependency builder is looking into
  the formattables instead of element. However, we then run into
  segmentation issues because we cannot find forward declarations on
  the main element.

To do:

- kernel registrar type index map - done.
- c# formatter registrar type index map - done.
- bug in template instantiating: artefact expansions do not seem to
  take kernel into account - done.

*Previous Understanding*

We need to make use of the exact same logic as implemented in
=quilt.cpp= for enablement. Perhaps all of the enablement related
functionality can be lifted and grafted onto quilt without any major
changes.

** Deprecated
*** CANCELLED Add description to profile and value templates          :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-07-14 Fri 12:08]

*Rationale*: it won't be needed in the new implementation of profiles.

It would be nice to put some kind of comments as to what the profile
is doing and where required, the rationale behind some defaulting on
the value templates. We probably should look into supporting
descriptions in data as a whole.

*** CANCELLED Consider renaming cpp's name builder to name factory    :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-07-14 Fri 12:09]

*Rationale*: we've already have a name builder.

The name builder is just a factory so make the name reflect it.

Actually, we don't just build names either.

*** CANCELLED Names in C++ namespaces                                 :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-07-14 Fri 12:10]

*Rationale*: story bit-rotted and now makes no sense.

It appears we are not using the entity name for a C++ namespace. If
that is the case, this is wrong and needs to be fixed. We are probably
inferring the name by looking at the =front= (or =back=) of the
namespaces list. Investigate this.

*** CANCELLED Change transformation code to use a type visitor        :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-07-14 Fri 12:12]

*Rationale*: story bit-rotted and now makes no sense.

Now we have a base type, we could probably simplify some of the
transformation code:

- dia to sml
- sml to c++
- potentially merger

*** CANCELLED Add a file formatter interface to formatters            :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-07-14 Fri 12:12]

*Rationale*: this does not fit our current understanding any more.

It probably makes sense to have a top-level interface for file
formatting in the formatters model. At present we have a lot of
=quilt.cpp= specific things in there. Maybe we should just extract the
common attributes and use them to create the generic interface.

This still makes sense after the current refactor, but it requires
some thinking.

Notes:

- formattable becomes a concept at the formatters' model level, but it
  has just an id.
- it seems we should be able to also have the formatters container and
  even the formatters workflow in =formatters=; however, this would
  increase the amount of casting required.

*** CANCELLED Add WinSock definition in CMakeLists for ODB support    :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-07-14 Fri 12:13]

*Rationale*: we are using ODB without any errors so no need for this
it seems.

We did a crude implementation of finding WinSock just to get windows
to build. There should be a FindWinSock somewhere. If not create one.

Do we need this anymore? we probably need it for linking the database
model, but we should check - maybe ODB has some magic around this.

Actually this was commented out in code so removed it. Was:

: # WinSock (for database)
: # if (WIN32)
: #     find_library(WSOCK_LIB NAMES wsock32 DOC "The winsock library")
: #     if(WSOCK_LIB)
: #         list(APPEND CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES wsock32)
: #     else()
: #         message(FATAL_ERROR "winsock not found.")
: #     endif()
:
: #     find_library(WSOCK2_LIB NAMES ws2_32 DOC "The winsock 2 library")
: #     if(WSOCK2_LIB)
: #         list(APPEND CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES ws2_32)
: #     else()
: #         message(FATAL_ERROR "winsock2 not found.")
: #     endif()
:
: #     find_library(MSWSOCK_LIB NAMES mswsock DOC "The winsock 2 library")
: #     if(MSWSOCK_LIB)
: #         list(APPEND CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES mswsock)
: #     else()
: #         message(FATAL_ERROR "mswsock not found.")
: #     endif()
: # endif()

*** CANCELLED Formatters' repository should be created in quilt       :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-07-14 Fri 12:17]

*Rationale*: we do not have quilt any longer.

At present we are creating the formatters' repository in
=quilt.cpp=. However it will be shared by all backends in the
kernel. Move it up to =quilt= level and supply it as a paramter to the
backends.

*** CANCELLED Comments seem to be trimmed                             :story:
    CLOSED: [2017-07-14 Fri 12:18]

*Rationale*: comments seem fine at the moment.

For some reason we seem to be munching any blank lines at the end of
comments. We should only remove the lines with the well known dogen
marker, all other lines should be left untouched.
