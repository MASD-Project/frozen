# Frozen

**Please do not use this repository unless you are doing it for testing**. If you are not a [Dogen](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen) developer, this repository is unlikely to be of any interest to you. ```frozen``` is the contents of Dogen, stopped in time at commit [972d0c3](https://github.com/MASD-Project/dogen/commit/972d0c3d29dcab5cdb9ce99be7e08e447fcd261d). At this point, we decided to discontinue the use of Dia and JSON codecs in mainline Dogen, in favour of Org. However, as the codecs themselves are still supported, we did not want their support to degrade over time. In order to do so we kept the code as-is, and we use it to ensure that future versions of Dogen generate these models correctly.

This repository will be updated periodically as we make changes to Dogen which result in changes to generated code. The models can also serve as examples of how to build Dia and JSON models. It serves no other sensible purpose, so please use it with caution.
